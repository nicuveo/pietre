## Pi√®tre documentation

Index:

- the [reference](reference.md) describes our toy language: syntax, grammar, and memory representation;
- the [grammar](pietre.gram) file describes the grammar in a PEG-like format; from it, two representations are generated:
    - a [DOT file](grammar.dot) that describes each language construct as a separate flowchart,
    - a [SVG representations](grammar.svg) of said DOT file, generated with `dot`;
- the [implementation guide](implementation.md) details how the code of this project is organised.
